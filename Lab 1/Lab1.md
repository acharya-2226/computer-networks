# Lab 1: Connection of Network Devices Using Ethernet

## Step 1: Preparation of Ethernet Cable with RJ45 Connectors

### Materials Required:
- Ethernet cable (Cat5e or Cat6)
- RJ45 connectors
- Crimping tool
- Wire stripper
- Cable tester

### Procedure:

#### Type 1: Straight-through Cable
1. Cut the Ethernet cable to the desired length.
2. Strip about 1 inch of the outer jacket from both ends of the cable using the wire stripper.
3. Untwist the pairs of wires and arrange them according to the T568B wiring standard:
   - Pin 1: White/Orange
   - Pin 2: Orange
   - Pin 3: White/Green
   - Pin 4: Blue
   - Pin 5: White/Blue
   - Pin 6: Green
   - Pin 7: White/Brown
   - Pin 8: Brown
4. Trim the wires to ensure they are all the same length.
5. Insert the wires into the RJ45 connector, ensuring each wire goes into its respective slot.
6. Use the crimping tool to secure the RJ45 connector onto the cable.
7. Repeat steps 2-6 for the other end of the cable.
8. Test the cable using a cable tester to ensure proper connectivity.

#### Type 2: Crossover Cable
1. Follow steps 1-4 from the straight-through cable procedure.
2. For one end of the cable, arrange the wires according to the T568A wiring standard:
   - Pin 1: White/Green
   - Pin 2: Green
   - Pin 3: White/Orange
   - Pin 4: Blue
   - Pin 5: White/Blue
   - Pin 6: Orange
   - Pin 7: White/Brown
   - Pin 8: Brown
3. For the other end of the cable, arrange the wires according to the T568B wiring standard:
   - Pin 1: White/Orange
   - Pin 2: Orange
   - Pin 3: White/Green
   - Pin 4: Blue
   - Pin 5: White/Blue
   - Pin 6: Green
   - Pin 7: White/Brown
   - Pin 8: Brown
4. Trim the wires to ensure they are all the same length.
5. Insert the wires into the RJ45 connectors, ensuring each wire goes into its respective slot.
6. Use the crimping tool to secure the RJ45 connectors onto the cable.
7. Test the cable using a cable tester to ensure proper connectivity.
